                <p>
                &emsp; I have been programming for about 7 years now; Since my Junior year of high school. I enjoy coding in Java, Javascript, Python, Node.js, HTML, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, BASH and several other programming / scripting languages. I have worked on several WebApps, Java projects, and Node.js projects as a contracter, as well as many personal projects.

                Outside of school I enjoy building computers and working with technology. I work at the Geek Squad, so I get to play with the latest tech all the time. I also enjoy playing video games, primarily on PC, but also on Nintendo Switch. Reddit is probably my biggest timesink currently.

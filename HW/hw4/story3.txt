Some say the world will end in --Noun--,

Some say in --Noun--.

From what Iâ€™ve tasted of --Emotion--

I hold with those who favor --Noun--.

But if it had to --Verb-- twice,

I think I know enough of --Emotion--

To say that for destruction --Noun--

Is also --Adjective--

And would suffice.


Original Poem: FIRE AND ICE by Robert Frost
